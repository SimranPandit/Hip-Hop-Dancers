		<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>

		Hip-hop dance is a fusion dance genre that incorporates elements of popping, locking, breaking, jazz, ballet, tap dancing and other styles and is typically performed to hip-hop, R&B, funk, electronic or pop music.
		</p>

		<p>
		The term is also used as an exonym and umbrella term for various street dance styles either performed to hip-hop music or that have become associated with hip-hop culture. It includes a wide range of styles created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States. The television show Soul Train and the 1980s films Breakin', Beat Street and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages; it gave these styles and hip-hop national exposure.
		</p>

		<p>
		What distinguishes the hip-hop dance genre from its component styles is that in hip-hop dance the dancing is typically well-choreographed and is often performed as part of an ensemble. In contrast, its component styles such as breaking or popping are freestyle-oriented whether it's performed solo or as a group. The introduction hip-hop dance and its component styles outside the United States have resulted in dance showcases, dance classes and competitions that have helped maintain their presence and growth worldwide. There are several international hip-hop dance competitions such as the UK B-Boy Championships, Juste Debout, and EuroBattle. Australia hosts a team-based, competition called World Supremacy Battlegrounds and Japan hosts a two-on-two competition called World Dance Colosseum.
